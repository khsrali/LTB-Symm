# TB-twist-bilayer
To my best knowledge there is no TB code publicly available for bi-layer and 2d materials. 
I would like to publish this library at some point and get citations, please keep it private for now.

This code has potential to turn into a smarter tool, for others who just want to input any desired input structre for twisted bi-layer, like XYZ and get the levels output...  without worryng about the indeces of atoms, orientations, local normal vercor (to be developed).

Moreover, if we combine with Jin's code -the one makes bilayer-. We can make something for absolute idiot people, who don't want to do any effort but just entering any desired misfit angle and get a picture.

As the state of the code untill now -24/10-
please just read and run it for yourself, aviod commiting, still there are some crucial fixes and ideas I have which can make it much faster. 
right now, 50 K-point of misfit=1.05 takes around 40 minutes... I believe that can get reduced to ~20 minutes.
