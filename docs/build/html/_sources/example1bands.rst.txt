Example 1: Band structure of TBG
--------------------------------

Here I demonstrate how to calculate band structre for magic angle twisted bilayer graphene.


First import ``ltbsymm`` and other libraries if you need, in this case also ``numpy``:

.. code:: ipython3

    import ltbsymm as ls
    import numpy as np

Initiate TightBinding module:

.. code:: ipython3

    mytb = ls.TB()

Next, load the coordinate file. ``1.08_1AA.data`` is an example of relaxed structure using ``LAMMPS``. For detail of this relaxation you can contact its creator  `Dr. Jin Wang <jinwang@sissa.it>`_ .


.. code:: ipython3

    mytb.set_configuration('1.08_1AA.data', r_cut = 5.7, local_normal=True)
 
**r_cut** used to detect neighbors within a circular range around each individual cites.
**local_normal=True** clarifies whether to calculate the local normal vector, pointing out from surface. This option is practical in case your structure is not flat, and out of plain deformations affects how orbitals interacts, Slatter-Koster. Phys. Rev., 94:1498â€“1524, 1954.
 
    
Depending on size of your system, you may want to save this initial configuration! This will help you to save time for next runs with the same data file and setting.

.. code:: ipython3

    mytb.save(configuration =True)

    
The heart of any band structure calculation is the Hamiltonian. Hopefully in LTB-Symm your hand are completely free! Define your Hamiltonian as you like, using features that are already developed. 
In the case of (twisted-bilayer-graphene)TBG we definde the Hamiltonian as:

.. math::

    H_{ij}= V_{pp\sigma} \left( (\frac{\textbf{d}_{ij} \cdot \hat{n_i} }{ \mid\textbf{d}_{ij}\mid  })^2 + (\frac{\textbf{d}_{ij} \cdot \hat{n_i} }{ \mid\textbf{d}_{ij}\mid  })^2 \right)/2  +  V_{pp\pi}  \left( 1-( (\frac{\textbf{d}_{ij} \cdot \hat{n_j} }{ \mid\textbf{d}_{ij}\mid  })^2 + (\frac{\textbf{d}_{ij} \cdot \hat{n_j} }{ \mid\textbf{d}_{ij}\mid  })^2 )/2 \right)
    

Where :math:`V_{pp\sigma}` and :math:`V_{pp\pi}` are defined

    
.. math::

    V_{pp\sigma} = V_{pp\sigma}^0 \; \exp{\left(-\frac{ \mid\textbf{d}_{ij}\mid -d_0}{r_0}\right)}, \;\;\; V_{pp\pi} = V_{pp\pi}^0 \; \exp{\left(-\frac{ \mid\textbf{d}_{ij}\mid -a_0}{r_0}\right)}

This Hamiltonian translate into the following Python function:
    
.. code:: ipython3

    # Define Hamiltonian and fix the parameters of the Hamiltonian that are the same for all pairs 
    def H_ij(v_ij, ez_i, ez_j, a0 = 1.42039011, d0 = 3.344, V0_sigam = +0.48, V0_pi = -2.7, r0 = 0.184* 1.42039011 * np.sqrt(3) ):
        """
            Args:
                d0: float
                    Distance between two layers. Notice d0 <= than minimum interlayer distance, otherwise you are exponentially increasing interaction!
                a0: float
                    Equilibrium distance between two neghibouring cites.
                V0_sigam: float
                    Slater-Koster parameters
                V0_pi: float
                    Slater-Koster parameters
                r0: float
                    Decay rate of the exponential
        """

        dd = np.linalg.norm(v_ij)
        V_sigam = V0_sigam * np.exp(-(dd-d0) / r0 )
        V_pi    = V0_pi    * np.exp(-(dd-a0) / r0 )
        
        tilt_1 = np.power(np.dot(v_ij, ez_i)/ dd, 2)
        tilt_2 = np.power(np.dot(v_ij, ez_j)/ dd, 2)
        t_ij =  V_sigam * (tilt_1+tilt_2)/2 + V_pi * (1- (tilt_1 + tilt_2)/2) 
        
        return t_ij


Now that the Hamiltonian is defined, it is time to define reciprocal space. 
In the simple case of TBG, LTB-Symm is able to detect mini brillouin zone (MBZ) automatically.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Define MBZ and set K-points
    mytb.MBZ()
    mytb.set_Kpoints(['K1','Gamma','M2', 'K2'] , N=32)

We may set a path :py:func:`set_Kpoints()` with N=32 K-points.
    
Now everything is basically set, electronic bands are ready to calculate

.. code:: ipython3

    # For twisted bilayer graphene sigma=np.abs(V0_pi-V0_sigam)/2 . An approximate value that flat bands are located
    mytb.calculate_bands(H_ij, n_eigns = 4, sigma=np.abs(-2.7-0.48)/2, solver='primme', return_eigenvectors = False) 

It is always a good idea to save the calculation!
    
.. code:: ipython3

    mytb.save(bands=True)

    
You could run this code in parallel, on as many cores. For example on 4 node, this calculation should take only around 200 seconds

.. code-block:: console

   $ mpirun -n 4 python input_calculate.py
        
        
Congratulation! now bands are calculated it is time for fun!


Before plotting, let us see if there are any flatbands

.. code:: ipython3

    # Detect if there are any flatbands
    mytb.detect_flat_bands()

    
Then you realize there are 4 flat bands, but are not centered around zero. The reason for that is the approximate value of **sigma** that is used in :py:func:`mytb.calculate_bands()` . This can be fixed simply by recentering flat bands around a given K-point:

.. code:: ipython3

    # Set Fermi level by shifting E=0 to the avergage energies of flat bands at point e.g. 'K1' 
    mytb.shift_2_zero('K1', np.array([0,1,2,3]))

Finally, you can plot and save the band structure.
    
.. code:: ipython3

    # Plot bands and modify figure as you like
    plot = mytb.plotter_bands(color_ ='C0') 
    plot.set_ylim([-10,15])
    plt.savefig('out_1.08_1AA/'+'Bands_'+ ".png", dpi=150) 

    plt.show()


.. image:: _images/Bands_N32.png
   :width: 400px


For denser a calculation we could set N=1000 in :py:func:`set_Kpoints()` . That would certainly takes more than 200 seconds :), but it looks nicer:

.. image:: _images/Bands_N1000.png
   :width: 400px


    

.. note::

    Alternatively you could close the seassion and load preveoiusly calculate bands:
    
    .. code:: ipython3

        mytb = ls.TB()
        mytb.load('out_1.08_1AA', bands='bands_.npz', configuration='configuration_.npz')
        plot = mytb.plotter_bands(color_ ='C0') 
        

.. warning::

    In case of using `mpirun`, it is better to assign only one core for plotting functions:
    
    .. code:: ipython3
    
        import numpy as np
        import ltbsymm as ls
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from mpi4py import MPI

        comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
        rank = comm.Get_rank()

        if rank == 0:   
            mytb = ls.TB()
            mytb.load('out_1.08_1AA', bands='bands_.npz', configuration='configuration_.npz')
            plot = mytb.plotter_bands(color_ ='C0')
            plt.show()
        
        MPI.Finalize()
